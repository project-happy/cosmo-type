## Main characteristics of entities
   * **Speed**: Entities can have different movement speeds, ranging from slow to fast. Faster entities require quicker typing skills, while slower ones allow players more time to react. Balancing                 the speed of entities is crucial to ensure the game remains challenging yet manageable
   * **Complexity**: Entities can vary in complexity, such as word length or sentence structure. Longer and more complex entities pose a greater challenge, while shorter and simpler ones provide a                      more accessible experience. Adjusting the complexity of entities across different levels or difficulties can help maintain a balanced gameplay progression
   * **Point Values**: Assigning point values to entities can incentivize players to type certain entities more efficiently. Longer or more challenging entities can be worth more points, rewarding                        players for successfully completing difficult typing tasks. Balancing the point values ensures that players are appropriately rewarded for their performance
   * To determine reasonable initial numbers for these characteristics, you can consider a combination of factors such as player skill level, desired difficulty curve, and gameplay pacing, for          example, you may start with a slower speed for the initial levels, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics, and gradually increase the speed as they progress. Assigning        higher point values to longer words or more complex sentences can provide an additional challenge while rewarding players for typing accurately and quickly
  
## Main Objects Placement
   * In this game, where players engage in modes such as normal mode, story mode, and teaching mode, the placement of the main objects may not be a significant aspect or directly applicable.
     In the normal mode, the focus is primarily on typing words or sentences presented to the player, rather than specific object placement. The challenge lies in accurately typing the words as          they appear on the screen.
     In the story mode, the player's progression through chapters and writing a chapter with each level suggests that the focus is on the narrative and the player's contribution to the story. The        placement of objects in this mode would be determined by the storyline and narrative elements rather than specific object placement mechanics.
     Similarly, in the teaching mode, the player's focus is on writing words in English and translating them into their own language. Object placement may not be a central aspect in this mode, as        the emphasis is on language learning and practice.
     While object placement can contribute to game balance and engagement in certain games, it may not play a significant role in our game. The balance and interest in this game would likely come        from factors such as the variety and difficulty of the words or sentences presented, the progression of levels or chapters, the integration of storytelling elements, and the language learning      aspects.
     Therefore, the placement of main objects may not be a key consideration in this game, as the primary focus lies in typing accuracy, narrative progression, and language learning.

## Main behaviors of the objects
    
  *  **Entity Movement**: In the normal mode of the game, entities (words or sentences) can move across the screen from top to bottom. The movement can vary in speed, requiring players to quickly                             type the words before they reach the bottom. This behavior adds a sense of urgency and challenges the player's typing speed and accuracy.   
  *  **Story Progression**: In the story mode, the behavior of entities is tied to the narrative. As the player completes each level, they write a chapter in the story. The behavior of the entities                             can be designed to reflect the theme or events of the story. For example, specific words or phrases may trigger certain actions or progress the narrative further.  
  *  **Scoring and Progression**: Throughout all modes, the game can track and reward the player's performance with a scoring system. Entities that are typed correctly earn points, while errors may                                   result in penalties. The scoring system can contribute to a sense of accomplishment and motivate players to improve their typing skills.
  * By implementing these behaviors, the game can create engaging and immersive experiences for players. The movement of entities, the progression of the story, the language translation aspect, and    the scoring system all contribute to a dynamic and challenging gameplay environment. 

## Economic System
 * On the game, where players can engage in different modes such as normal mode, story mode, and teaching mode, the game focus is primarily on the gameplay mechanics and learning aspects rather      than an internal or external economic system.
   Therefore, it is unlikely that the game would have an internal economic system involving in-game trading or commerce. The core gameplay revolves around typing words, progressing through          levels, and potentially advancing the story or learning new vocabulary.

## Game state
   * **Game State Information**: The player would typically have access to information such as the current level or chapter in story mode, the current word or sentence to type, the remaining time                                  or progress bar, the player's score or points, and any relevant feedback on typing accuracy.
   * **User Interface**: The game's user interface (UI) would display the necessary information to the player. This can include elements like a word/sentence display area, a timer or progress                              indicator, a score counter, and visual cues for feedback on typing accuracy.
   * **Player's Perspective**: The player's point of view would likely be focused on the word or sentence they are typing and the associated gameplay elements. The screen would primarily show the                                word/sentence to be typed, potentially with additional visual elements such as animations or effects. The player's attention would be directed towards completing                                  the typing task accurately and efficiently.
   * The chosen perspective emphasizes the core gameplay mechanics of typing and provides a clear focus for the player. By presenting the word/sentence prominently and minimizing distractions,        the game promotes engagement and concentration on the primary objective of typing accurately. This perspective allows players to fully immerse themselves in the typing experience and achieve      optimal performance.
     The decision to adopt this specific point of view is likely based on the nature of the game mechanics, where typing is the central activity. It helps create a direct and intuitive connection      between the player's actions and the gameplay outcomes, enhancing the overall player experience.
     
     
 ## Player Control
   * **Direct Control**: In the normal mode and teaching mode, the player typically has direct control over the game state. They have the ability to directly interact with the game by typing the                          words or sentences presented on the screen. The game responds in real-time to the player's input, registering their typing accuracy and speed. The player's actions                                directly influence the progression of the game and the outcome of each word or sentence  
   * **Indirect Control**: In the story mode, the player's control over the game state may be indirect. While they still type words or sentences, the game may also incorporate elements of                                    decision-making or branching narratives. The player's choices in typing or interacting with the story may lead to different outcomes or impact the direction of the                                narrative. Their control over the game state is exercised through the choices they make, which may have consequences in subsequent levels or chapters
   * The timing of control can also vary. In most cases, the game operates in real-time, immediately responding to the player's typing input. However, in certain situations, there may be pauses        or intervals between words or sentences, allowing the player time to process and prepare for the next challenge. The specific method of player control, whether direct or indirect, in real-        time or turn-based, depends on the design goals and mechanics of each mode within the game
 
 ## Player choices and strategies
   * **Typing Accuracy:**: Players need to focus on typing with accuracy to ensure that they input the correct words or translations. Paying attention to spelling, grammar, and punctuation can                              help them achieve higher scores and progress through the game
   * **Typing Speed**: Typing speed is crucial, especially in time-based or fast-paced modes. Players can practice their typing skills to increase their speed and improve their chances of                                completing words or sentences within the given time limit
   * **Prioritization**: In modes with multiple entities (words or sentences) on the screen simultaneously, players may need to prioritize which entities to type first. They can strategize by                              targeting longer words or higher-scoring entities to maximize their score or progress
